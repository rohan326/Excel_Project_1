## Project Workflow

1. **Extract Data**
   - Loaded data from multiple CSV and Excel tables (`Orders_Table`, `Customers_table`, `Products`) into Power Query.

2. **Preprocess Data**
   - Cleaned null values, removed duplicates, standardized column formats (dates, currency).
   - Ensured data consistency across different sources.

3. **Transform Data Using Power Query**
   - Merged tables based on foreign keys (`Customer_ID`, `Product_ID`).
   - Derived columns such as `Order Day`, `Revenue`, and `Order Time` using Power Query and custom logic.

4. **Load Data to Data Model**
   - Loaded transformed tables to Power Pivot for building relationships and optimized analytics.

5. **Apply DAX Calculations**
   - Created measures and calculated columns like:
     - Total Revenue
     - Average Customer Spending
     - Average Order Gap
     - Total Orders
   - Used DAX for time intelligence and ranking logic.

6. **Design Visualizations**
   - Created PivotTables and PivotCharts for each analysis dimension (time, category, geography, product).
   - Added slicers and timelines for dynamic interactivity.
   - Designed layout with consistent formatting and grouped elements for a clean dashboard view.
